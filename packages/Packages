 Take care that you don't include apache at the moment into your image
 please select it only as module because busybox will override
 /usr/sbin/httpd. It'll be solved soon. If you need to include this
 package in the image anyway, remove httpd from busybox
 (Base system --> Configuration --> Networking Utilities --> httpd).
 Also you should take care for the initscripts, apache's httpd isn't
 compatible with the one from busybox, so if you want to use apache
 for running your webif, you'll need to change the parameters in the
 scripts and configure the rest in /etc/httpd.conf.

 efficient and therefore appropriate for small embedded routers.
 
 This is a BIRD command-line client. It is used to send commands to BIRD,
 commands can perform simple actions such as enabling/disabling of
 protocols, telling BIRD to show various information, telling it to show
 a routing table filtered by a filter, or asking BIRD to reconfigure.
 
 Unless you can't afford dependency on ncurses and readline, you
 should install BIRD command-line client together with BIRD.

Description:  libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the
 terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections and
 (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other
 sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted
 strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include
 statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability
 to a program using a simple API.
 
 The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser
 library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use
 and quick to integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg
 before, but was changed to not confuse with other similar libraries.

 hosts to check. If a host does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry 
 limit it will be considered unreachable.

Description:  The Microcontroller Message Bus is a tiny SPI-GPIO based communication
 channel used to talk to microcontrollers over GPIO pins.
 The lowlevel protocol is CRC16 protected, so one can be pretty sure
 that the data transmitted and received through the /dev/ucmb node is not corrupted.
 So no further checks should be needed at upper protocol layers.
 The device node considers every read/write to be one packet. The maximum packet
 size is either PAGE_SIZE (at least 4kb) or the microcontroller specific packet size
 limit, which is likely to be a lot smaller than PAGE_SIZE.
 To register an ucmb device, simply create a struct ucmb_platform_data
 and register it via ucmb_device_register() from another kernel module.
 Example implementations for the microcontroller-side code can be found in
 the utils/ucmb/microcontroller_examples subdirectory of the OpenWRT packages feed.

Description:  It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface,
 looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client
 makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
 port on the server. This port need not be open -- since
 knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic
 even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server
 detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command
 defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open
 up holes in a firewall for quick access.
 This package contains the port-knocking client.

MD5Sum: d7cf5980bfc74ae650853193346038e7
Description:  It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface,
 looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client
 makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
 port on the server. This port need not be open -- since
 knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic
 even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server
 detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command
 defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open
 up holes in a firewall for quick access.
 This package contains the port-knocking server.

 Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network --
 this means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers
 to print to or find files being shared. This kind of technology is already
 found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 This package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries, used by other programs.
 Specifically, it provides libavahi-core and libavahi-common libraries.
 This version is compiled without D-Bus support, i.e. the --disable-dbus 
 compilation flag is set.

Description:  Libconfig is a simple library for manipulating structured configuration
 files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And
 unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
 parsing in application code.
 
 Libconfig is very compact -- just 38K for the stripped C shared
 library (less than one-fourth the size of the expat XML parser library)
 and 66K for the stripped C++ shared library. This makes it well-suited
 for memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.

Description:  libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 - A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure of a process
 - A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to Syslog or STDERR
 - An API for writing PID files
 - An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with select() or poll()
 - An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 
 APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not that
 simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

Description:  OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
 devices easily accessible. The underlying priciple is to create a virtual
 filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
 properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read
 and written.
 
 Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a
 consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a
 software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are
 some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,
 parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
 Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness
 rather than speed.
 
 This package contains the OWFS C-API library.

 Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a
 consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a
 software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are
 some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,
 parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
 Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness
 rather than speed.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains a shared library, used by other programs.

Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

 flexible models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python
 calling and scoping semantics.

Description:  mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
 shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-
 milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh
 derivate currently being actively developed.  It includes bug
 fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
 robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (e.g. in the emacs editing mode); R38c
 corresponds to OpenBSD 4.5-current ksh (without GNU bash-like
 S1 and fancy character classes).  The code has throughoutly
 been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli-
 ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi-
 lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own)
 have been placed.

Description:  mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs
 in a single network diagnostic tool.
 As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
 mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it
 determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.

Description:  NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that visually
 represents the network performance under a variety of conditions. It
 performs simple ping-pong tests, bouncing messages of increasing size
 between two processes, whether across a network or within an SMP
 system. Message sizes are chosen at regular intervals, and with slight
 perturbations, to provide a complete test of the communication system.
 Each data point involves many ping-pong tests to provide an accurate
 timing. Latencies are calculated by dividing the round trip time in
 half for small messages ( < 64 Bytes ).

Description:  OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
 devices easily accessible. The underlying priciple is to create a virtual
 filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
 properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read
 and written.
 
 Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a
 consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a
 software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are
 some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,
 parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
 Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness
 rather than speed.
 
 This package contains the OWFS fuse filesystem.

 well) as a low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention 
 in PPP connection scripts. It could also prove useful in many other 
 similar tasks.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains the rrdcgi tool used to create web pages containing
 RRD graphs based on templates.

Description:  Seeks is a free and open P2P design and application for enabling social
 websearch. Its specific purpose is to regroup users whose queries
 are similar so they can share both the query results and their
 experience on these results. On this basis, Seeks allows for true
 real-time, decentralized, websearch to emerge.
 
 In the long term, there is no need for web crawlers and third-party
 web indexes as users can push content directly to search groups.
 By hashing queries, Seeks offers a unique solution that allows to
 issue queries and get answers while not revealing the true query itself.
 
 Seeks is currently under development. Code is available from our git
 repository. Help on any of the social, technical and software matters
 is greatly encouraged and appreciated, see the dedicated page.

Description:  uAnytun is a tiny implementation of SATP the secure anycast tunneling protocol.
 SATP defines a protocol used for communication between any combination of 
 unicast and anycast tunnel endpoints.  It has less protocol overhead than 
 IPSec in Tunnel mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g.
 ethernet, ip, arp ...). SATP directly includes cryptography and message 
 authentication based on the methodes used by SRTP.  It is intended to deliver 
 a generic, scaleable and secure solution for tunneling and relaying of packets 
 of any protocol.
 Unlike Anytun which is a full featured implementation uAnytun has no support 
 for multiple connections or synchronisation. It is a small single threaded 
 implementation intended to act as a client on small platforms.

Description:  This program listens for packets on a specified UDP broadcast port.
 When a packet is received, it sends that packet to all specified interfaces but 
 the one it came from as though it originated from the original sender.
 The primary purpose of this is to allow games on machines on separated 
 local networks (Ethernet, WLAN) that use udp broadcasts to find each other to do so.
 It also works on ppp links, so you can log in from windows boxes (e.g. using pptp) 
 and play LAN-based games together. Currently, you have to care about upcoming or 
 downgoing interfaces yourself.
